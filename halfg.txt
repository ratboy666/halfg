Back in August 1974, Popular Electronics published the plans for
the "Scopewriter". This was a device that would display 32 characters
in a single line on an oscilloscope.

I took the raster character set set as published, and display
messages using this character font. I used 2x2 graphics using UTF-8
(supported by most terminal emulators). This gives 160x48 graphics.

I wrote this program in MicoSoft BASIC-80 (MBASIC) -- halfg.bas

The main purpose is to illustrate 2x2 cell graphics on XTERM and
other terminal emulators.
