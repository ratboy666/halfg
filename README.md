# halfg

Playing around with UTF-8 and MicroSoft MBASIC. Uses 2x2 half-cell graphics to allow plotting on
a 160x48 grid in xterm or other terminal emulator.

Just good fun. Also contains August 1974 Popular Electronics "Scopewriter" font. Again, just for
fun -- renders "HELLO" in that font in half-cell graphics.
